# Description

This program uses OpenGL, GLSL, and C++ code to design a free-look camera. The scene contains 100 objects consisting of bunnies and teapots and a sun placed overhead. I used the Blinn-Phong shading formula to shade each object. The camera can be controlled by pressing `wasd` keys. Pressing `t` will open up a top-down view of the world which features a view frustum.
